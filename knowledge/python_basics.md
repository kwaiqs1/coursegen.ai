# Variables
In Python, variables are symbolic names that act as containers for storing data values. They allow you to refer to and manipulate data within your programs.
Key characteristics of Python variables:
No explicit declaration:
Unlike some other programming languages, Python does not require you to explicitly declare the type of a variable before using it. A variable is created the moment you assign a value to it.
Dynamic typing:
Python is dynamically typed, meaning the type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it. You can reassign a variable to hold a value of a different data type.
Assignment operator:
The assignment operator (=) is used to assign a value to a variable.
Referencing objects:
Variables in Python are essentially references to objects in memory. When you assign a value to a variable, the variable points to the memory location where that value is stored.
Naming conventions:
Variable names should be descriptive and follow Python's naming conventions (e.g., lowercase with underscores for multiple words). They cannot start with a number and are case-sensitive. 


Example of variable creation and usage:
1) Creating an integer variable: 
age = 30

2) Creating a string variable:
name = "Alice"

3) Creating a float variable:
price = 19.99

4) Reassigning a variable:
age = "thirty"

5) Printing variable values:
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Price: {price}")
